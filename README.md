# Tab Grouper

## A chrome extension that will automatically group all tabs by the domain name unless there is only one tab open for that domain.

Currently available at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fkpmakflpdgeblkpdklpoohabkdghjpd

Current Limitations

- Will only group tabs in a single window.
- If a domain tab group exists in one window, any tabs of the same domain in another window will be sent to the original group. ie only a single tab domain group can exist. (It's a feature not a bug?)

tl;dr it may break if trying to use it across multiple windows.
